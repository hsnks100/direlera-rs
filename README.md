# direlera-rs

This is a project to rewrite kaillera server in rust.

I've had a lot of memories with Netplay from before, but I wanted to try making a Kaillera server someday. server name is 'Direlera'

The orientation of the server is as follows.
1. Aim for fast response speed.
2. Eliminate operationally unstable factors such as server crashes.

I have a job and I can't spend all my time here, so only basic functions are still available and there are no convenience functions.
