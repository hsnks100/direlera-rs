Kaillera is software called middleware. It brings you the possibility to play video
games online through the use of emulators.
It consists of a client and a server. The client is usually embedded into your
favorite emulator and the server is a stand-alone application that needs to be run
on a machine directly wired to the Internet.
► Kaillera features:
- Small, fast and efficient C++ code.
- UDP use for better latency.
- Intelligent networking cache code.
- Multi-platform support.
- Low to no lag for players with good ping.
- Works through firewalls.
- LANs/WANs support.
•••••••••••••••••
• OPEN KAILLERA •
•••••••••••••••••
Open Kaillera is an open-source client library, aimed to extend and improve
maintaining backward-compatibility with the Kaillera netplay protocol.
► Mode 1. P2P
Host must select host tab and then the game they want to play. The player hosting
must send the client their IP address. Client copies and enters the IP in the
'Connect' tab then click 'Connect'. If the hosts ports are not blocked the client
should be able to join the hosted game room. Both players must check the 'click
here when ready' box for the game to start. Select 'Record game' before starting
the game to have the game recorded for later viewing.
► Mode 2. Client
When a desync occurs mid-game in a server, click 'Drop' in the Kaillera client to
disconnect and unfreeze game, so you can re-enter to the server without the need to
end the program via Task Manager.
► Mode 3. Playback
Recorded games are saved as .krec files in a record folder which is automatically
created in the same directory as your emulator. Press refresh for new files to show
on the Playback list. The replay is shown through the emulator. It's not a video
file, basically keystrokes are recorded during playthrough and imitated during
playback automatically.

• EMULINKERSF •
•••••••••••••••
EmuLinker is a high-performance, scalable, secure, open-source re-implementation of
the Kaillera network protocol server.
EmuLinkerSF is a modified version of the original EmuLinker server created by
Moosehead with new features by SupraFast.
► EmuLinker features (Implementation):
- Written 100% in Java.
- Designed following the MVC pattern for extensibility.
- Modular design using PicoContainer.
- Highly concurrent for performance using concurrency APIs in Java 1.5.
► EmuLinker features (Server):
- Stops all know hacks and exploits from the original Kaillera server by using
strong buffer, boundary, and overflow checking.
- Does not allow interruption of games in progress.
- Game desynch detection and notification.
- Intelligent desynch handling: if one player drops or lags, others can continue
playing.
- International language support.
- Prevents emulator lockup when game starter drops quickly.
- Multiple user access levels with a comprehensive set of escape commands for
online server administration.
- Aggressive spam control with chat message and game name validation.
- Games remember users that were kicked to prevent annoying re-joining.
- Duplicate user login protection with reconnection handling.
- Game and emulator filters enable server owners to run a server intended for a
specific game, and/or restrict playing of a specific game or games.
- Maximum game setting to help limit bandwidth usage.
- Uses a configurable limited range of network ports instead of any available port,
making firewall setup easier than the original server.
- Inactivity timeout prevents extended user idling.
- Extensive logging of all server activity with automatic log file rotation.
- Domain name support in access file allows for each configuration for people
without a static IP address.
- Unique Autofire Detector feature can alert players about possible cheating.

inside a game room.
/p2pon ~ /p2poff - Allows faking P2P. This option ignores all the
server activity during gameplay.
/samedelay true ~ false - Allows the host to set the game delay. If the owner
chooses to play with the same delay,
 all the players will be playing with the delay of
the user with the worst ping.
/setemu - Restricts the game room to the emulator the host is
using. Ex. “MAME32k”, “Project64k”, etc.
/setconn - Allows a user to restrict the connection type to
the one the user has set up for itself.
/startn # - The game will start automatically when a certain
amount of users join to the game room.
/swap # - Swap the controls for each user in the game room.**
 **Compatible with all the emulators (except ePSXe).
------------------------
Kaillera client commands (Nov 1 2007)
------------------------
• General commands
/clear - Allows a user to clear all the text of the general
chat.
/pcs - Similar to the “stats” command: shows the amount of
lost/misorder packets.
/reconnect - Allows a user to reconnect to the server
automatically.
/stats - Allows a user to see what is the bandwidth consumed
on the server in real-time.
/swm - Allows a user to switch the screen between its
current game room and the server's games list.
-------------
UOKS commands (v0.92)
-------------
• Game room commands
/lagreset - Resets the lag-checking system (use it shortly
before /lagstat if game has been running awhile).
/lagstat - Displays the number of lag spikes each game room
user has.
/limit # - Sets user limit for game lobby. User limit defaults
to 8, and can't be changed to a number less than the number of users currently in
the game, nor can it be changed to a number greater than the user limit of the
server, or 32, whichever is less. User limits are enforced.
/start - This command starts the game, the same as the start
button in the default client. This is necessary so that game hosts who have
'inherited' their power from a previous host leaving the game can still start the
game, despite their client not otherwise having an interface for it.
/swap #### - Remaps user inputs on the fly, while game is
playing. User inputs are reset on game start. Only the first 8 user inputs can be
remapped, or used for remapping. Duplicates are allowed. The numbers supplied are
the original player numbers, and are not affected by previous '/swap' commands.
Using a '0' for a player's input means 'don't change from previous mapping'. The
first example '/swap 01' does not change the input currently used for player 1, but
uses player 1's input for player 2. The second example '/swap 20663' uses player
2's input for player 1, player 6's input for 3 and 4, and player 3's input for 5.
/swapreset - This command resets all input mappings in the game
to the state they would be in if no '/swap' commands had ever been issued.

► Why is my game so laggy when I play? | What is lag? What is desync? What does
"Ping" mean?
When you play games over the Internet, you can be playing against someone that is
across the world. When speed is concerned, you start to run into concept of the
speed of light.
Say I'm in New York, and I want to play a server in Tokyo. That's about 6760 miles.
The speed of light is approximately 186,000 miles per second. In ideal conditions,
your signal has to go from your computer to the server, and back. Assume that this
electronic communication happens at the speed of light. (Which it does not. There
are other problems due to overhead, A/D conversions, etc. Not to mention that
electricity travels a bit slower than the speed of light.)
So, we have to go 6760 miles there, and 6760 miles back. That's 13520 miles. At the
speed of light, it would take about 72.688 ms ([13520mi / 186000 mi/sec] *
1000ms/sec). So, at best you can have a 72 ms ping. (Not taking into account time
lost by routing hops, A/D conversion, network overhead, latency, etc.)
You really can't defeat the speed of light.
• Lag: AKA network latency and ping time. If you say you are "lagging",
network-savvy people are going to think that when you press a key, your actions are
delayed. Lag is NOT shown when you are playing but the game appears to have locked
and none of the keys work. That is called...
• Packet Loss: Over the TCP/IP and UDP protocols and the others, data is sent out
in little packets of data. I believe it is approximately a few hundred bytes,
(someone who knows, please let me know). The receiving computer reassembles these
packets, according to stamps on them, into what it was supposed to be. In UDP,
which Kaillera uses, these can be received out of order and there's a timestamp on
them so that they can expire. Ex.: If you're playing a fighter and you press a
punch, you don't want it to be received after the kick you pressed first; fighting
would be downright hilarious. You may never get a UDP packet since it is just sent
once and that's it. Once it's expired, if your computer ever DOES get it, the
packet is checked against the computer's clock and just ignores it.
In TCP/IP, packet loss does not happen as often, and the participating computers
connection seems to last longer, usually until both computers feel the connection
has just been lost. (This is why IRC, laggy as all hell, still works). TCP/IP
replies with what we call an "ACK" (acknowledgement) when a packet has been
received. Until that, the other computer keeps sending the little packet out until
it gets the "ACK". The problem is, this takes up bandwidth on a connection, thus
for things like Kaillera, UDP is much more preferred so lag can be reduced.
• Choppiness: You will see choppiness in the game if there is some lag happening.
The resulting effect from packet loss in UDP is that you may have some packets that
are not received. This would not only cause lag, since the timing would be held
back, but you may also miss a transmitted move or button press. One of the benefits
of UDP is that all of the bandwidth of both computers is used to full and not
wasted resending packets. The problem is if a packet is not received the computer
that was supposed to get it has nothing to do. With the way Kaillera is set up,
(which it has to be, or desyncs would occur whenever a packet is lost) the program
is set to stick until it receives a packet so the other player(s) can move. Work
some brain cells for a second and you can see this was the only sensible thing to
do. This prevents Kaillera from desyncing. Those of you who frequently get perfect
games feel rested: you are getting relatively low packet loss: less than 5%. 0 is
quite uncommon just because there's so much traffic everywhere. High speed
connections usually have much lower rates of packet loss than dialup. This entire
process works so fast however that even though you think you're playing a smooth
game, packets are still getting dropped and despite the fact that this is
happening, you can't tell Kaillera has stopped working for 2 milliseconds.
In addition, Kaillera implements modern technology which make UDP packet
transmission much more reliable. But even with that, if your connection is bad,
there's no magical way around it.
If your games keep getting choppy, check out what's going on with your Internet
connection. For instance, if you're in the middle of any file transfer while
playing with Kaillera or are using other bandwidth-eating applications.
► What is the "Connection" setting used for, and what should I put there?
You usually should leave it on it's default setting of "Good". The "Connection"
setting will tell Kaillera how many packets it will send each second. A rate of 20
packets per second is usually good for all types of connections. See the above
entry regarding packet loss. If you send less packets per second, the connection
will be more reliable and your game will be less choppy. The downside is that if
you choose a connection setting too low, you may feel that it is too tough to
complete complicated moves, such as those required in most common fighting games.
The "Good" setting is truly and decent medium.
► Help! My game goes out of sync! (aka. desync) Why?
Desync is a thorn in the side of playing emulators over a network. If you want to
know why this also happens in PC games, keep reading this paragraph, otherwise skip
down a bit. This also comes up in real time strategy games. For example Starcraft,
those of you that play(ed) it, you know each player can have around 100 or more
units, not to mention buildings, at once. Maybe each on screen "entity" takes about
200 bytes. That's 200 entities for each player, 4 kilobytes for those entities. If
there are 8 players, that's 32k. Your 56k modem can not send 32 kilobytes per
second reliably. In the game Black and White, you can have unlimited amounts of
villagers. The more villagers, the more houses, food, wood, and prayer power you
get. That's a ton of data that needs to be sent to EVERY player. Peer-to-Peer games
do not usually send every single piece of data to each computer. Obviously, that
would be too much data to send consistently, and quite a waste of time. So instead,
they do something like what Kaillera does, send tiny updates.
In essence, Kaillera just sends keystrokes. The server you connect to is the host,
NOT whoever makes the room for the game. Every key you press while playing is sent
to the server you connect to and it then routes it back to you and to everyone
else. Again, it does not matter who hosts a game, the playing experience on a
single server will be the pretty much the same unless one player reconnects to
their ISP.
When you press a key while in Kaillera, as stated above, it is sent to the server
and sent to everyone else:
 - Player 1
 /
Server - Player 2
 \
 - Player 3
If player 1 presses punch, it goes to the server, and then it follows the lines
back to each player. If one player is experiencing heavy packet loss, all players
stick because as mentioned in the above topic:
Kaillera waits for keystrokes. As you can imagine this is very unreliable. It's
like telling a person to remember a sentence for you and you can tell them to go
back and forward, delete words and add words. If one of you screws up going
forward, back, add or remove and then you both write the sentence out, you get
modified sentences. The result is one of you could still have the correct new
sentence but since the other person screwed up, you are "desynced". This is exactly
what happens with a desync. One of the player's Kaillera will "think" about
something differently. It could also be caused by packet corruption that was
somehow received (though the likelihood of that is low, it does happen). Since
nothing but keys are sent, there is no way currently feasible to synchronize. One
possibility that is being explored is to copy byte for byte the game's "state" from
one computer to all the others. Technically you could "teleport" if you were
playing a game like Dungeons & Dragons, to each other and you would be synched but
usually it's not that easy. You could have different scores and stuff. This tiny
update stuff is the blind leading the blind. Each client blindly assumes the other
clients have exactly what it has. Usually this works. When there's a desync, it
doesn't.
With the keystroke method the best way to check for a desync is compare scores.
Tell each player your score and have them tell you what they see your score as. If
it's different, you're desynced. You can also check to see if players are hitting
the air.
Packet corruption would seem the most likely culprit for desync. This is when
somehow, over the network, the packet gets a bit or more changed in it. TCP/IP has
a quick check I think and discards corrupted packets and doesn't send the ACK. UDP
doesn't care, and just drops it. Corrupted packets are supposed to be dropped but
it can be possible to receive a corrupted packet and try to use it. I don't think
this happens often. Usually corruption is faulty hardware. I don't know if this is 
the case, but if these corrupted packets are sent off as being correct, received
and used, this causes HORRIBLY unwanted results.

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Q: What's this?
A: It's a Kaillera client file for Kaillera supported emulators that allows you to
connect directly to your opponent to play.
Q: Why would I want to connect directly? What's wrong with playing with normal
client in Kaillera servers?
A: There's nothing wrong with playing with normal client in Kaillera servers. This
isn't a replacement for our good old trusty reliable Kaillera. This is merely an
extra option for users who wants to directly connect to their opponent's machine
and play with half the response delay of playing in Kaillera servers.
Q: I hosted and my IP address is 127.0.0.1:27886 but how come my friend can't
connect? How do I get my IP?
A: 127.0.0.1 is the loopback IP address. I.e. it will always point to your own
computer. So someone on the Internet or even your local network can't connect on
the Internet to you using this IP address. To connect you will need your external
IP address.
https://www.whatismyip.com/
Q: Does it give any advantage to low pingers over high pingers like normal
Kaillera?
A: No. Ping (a.k.a. latency) can be seen as a network property between 2 endpoints.
There are only 2 endpoints in P2P and hence both users share the same ping.
Q: How do I change my connection setting to "Good" connection setting?
A: You can't! By default, it behaves like "LAN" on Kaillera. If you are having lag
spike problems, an option to allow for one and two extra frames delay to smooth the
game out further has been added and is configurable by host.
Q: Does host have any advantage? How is host different to connector?
A: No. Host is obviously the one who is connected to. Host has the privilege of
taking certain initiatives such as calculating average ping and throughput but
nothing special. Client's clock also gets synchronized emit the same time as host.
On the negative side, host needs to have the hosting port forwarded in the router
so the connector can connect. Once the game starts, both behave identically.
Q: Does host have to fill in the "Peer IP" box?
A: No. That's the only box the connector has to fill in. Host has to fill in
everything else.
Q: I did all that but the other player can't see my game.
A: The most probable reason for this is if you don't have your hosting ports
forwarded. By default, port is 27886/UDP must be forwarded to be able to host
games.
Q: It's possible to play via P2P with more than 2 players?
A: Unfortunately no. Use standard Kaillera servers which support up to 8 players
per game.
Q: How does it's delay compare to Kaillera?
A: The delay in it's vary close to half of the ping between the users (RTT/2)
whereas the delay in normal Kaillera should converge to ping between the user and
server (again RTT) as higher connection settings are used. Note that Kaillera as
well as most of the emulators who incorporate Kaillera are discrete implementations
and they works in terms of whole frames (typically and assumed to be 16.66667 ~ 17
ms) instead of fractions.
Q: Why are my games going choppy when I use this?
A: The connection between you and your peer isn't that consistent. Use the
"Smoothing" option when playing this peer.
- "If near UB" adds 8ms to your ping time before the delay is locked in.
- "Always" adds an extra frame of delay.
- "Extra" adds two extra frames of delay.

• UNOFFICIAL KAILLERA SERVER •
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
UOKS is an unofficial Kaillera server based on the original binary. It was produced
from the source code created by decompiling the original Kaillera server binary.
► UOKS features:
- Greatly improved internal security (several buffer overflow vulnerabilities
patched over, far more error-checking on the protocols to prevent unauthorized
commands / spoofing).
- Flood protection against chat flooding in game lobbies, as well as game creations
and joins.
- MotD support that should work with older Kaillera clients.
- Two automatic banning systems: one for banning users who have been flooding or
attempting buffer overflow exploits from entering the server, and one for
preventing users who have been kicked repeatedly from a game from rejoining it.
- Additional capabilities given to game lobby creators: setting a limit on the
number of users that can join the game, user input remapping, and banning a user.
- Game lobbies close only when empty, not when their creator leaves, the least
recent player to join the game (otherwise known as player 2) gains all powers of
the previous host (including commands to start the game and kick users from it,
since the client has no interface for providing for this case).
- Improved checking in loading the configuration file.
- Generally improved performance.
- Reduced difficulty in establishing an initial connection.
- Alerts displayed in game lobby when someone joins with a version different from
the current host/creator.
- Filtering of whitespace characters other than space characters (carriage returns,
tabs, etc.) out of chat messages.
